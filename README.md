# 42Cursus-minishell
The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. Yes, your<br/>
little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors<br/>

## Introduction:
The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all coders agreed<br/>
that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously<br/>
irritating. It was only logical that they came up with the idea to communicate with<br/>
a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to english.<br/>
With Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems<br/>
people faced when Windows didn’t exist.<br/>

### Your shell should:

- Not interpret unclosed quotes or unspecified special characters like \ or ;.<br/>
- Not use more than one global variable, think about it and be ready to explain why you do it.<br/>
- Show a prompt when waiting for a new command.<br/>
- Have a working History.<br/>
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or by using relative or absolute path)<br/>
- It must implement the builtins:<br/>
  - echo with option -n<br/>
  - cd with only a relative or absolute path<br/>
  - pwd with no options<br/>
  - export with no options<br/>
  - unset with no options<br/>
  - env with no options or arguments<br/>
  - exit with no options<br/>
- ’ inhibit all interpretation of a sequence of characters.<br/>
- " inhibit all interpretation of a sequence of characters except for $.<br/>
- Redirections:<br/>
  - “<“ should redirect input.<br/>
  - “>“ should redirect output.<br/>
  - “<<” read input from the current source until a line containing only the delimiter is seen. it doesn’t need to update history!<br/>
  - “>>” should redirect output with append mode.<br/>
- Pipes | The output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe to the input of the next command.<br/>
- Environment variables ($ followed by characters) should expand to their values.<br/>
- $? should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.<br/>
- ctrl-C ctrl-D ctrl-\ should work like in bash.<br/>
- When interactive:<br/>
  - ctrl-C print a new prompt on a newline.<br/>
  - ctrl-D exit the shell.<br/>
  - ctrl-\ do nothing.<br/>

<p readline function can produce some leak you don’t need to fix this.<br/>
But beware your own code should not produce leaks.<br/>
You should limit yourself to the subject description.<br/>
Anything not asked is not required.<br/>
For every point, if you have any doubt take bash as a reference.<br/></p>
